## Apartment Rental Price Prediction
Welcome to the Apartment Rental Price Prediction project! This project focuses on predicting rental prices for apartments in Germany using a dataset from Kaggle. Our goal is to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model that can help landlords, tenants, and real estate professionals estimate rental prices more effectively.

## Dataset
We leverage the dataset available on Kaggle, which includes a rich collection of features related to German apartments. This dataset allows us to explore the various factors that influence rental prices, such as location, size, amenities, and more. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/corrieaar/apartment-rental-offers-in-germany?resource=download).
